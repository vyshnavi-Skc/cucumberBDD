How to check if we have given the stepdef for all the steps:
1) right click on the project ->configure -> convert to cucumber project ->it will take long time to make every time
2) by default: it will run one by one and fail only once it reaches the steps whcih has no stepdef defined
to overcome this we have option dryrun, by which it will not run  it ensures that if we have the implementation

@cucumberOptions(plugin = {"usage"})
for reports

Rerun plugin: using it we can create the failed report file 
	need to create runner file and using@we will provide the path fo the failedscenarios.txt file (report file generated with rerun option)
	
	
	extend report in cucumber:
	we need 2 dependencies for using extend reports
	<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.aventstack/extentreports -->
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.aventstack</groupId>
	    <artifactId>extentreports</artifactId>
	    <version>5.0.9</version>
	</dependency>
	<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/tech.grasshopper/extentreports-cucumber7-adapter -->
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>tech.grasshopper</groupId>
	    <artifactId>extentreports-cucumber7-adapter</artifactId>
	    <version>1.9.2</version>
	</dependency>
	We have selceted 1.9.2 which i most suitable with testng and selenium versions
	
	After this we need to include a plugin in runner class, and create the extent.properties file to specific properties for creating extent report
	
	
	hooks in cucumber  is similar to the before and after anootations in testng selenium
